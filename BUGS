KNOWN BUGS
----------

PROGRAM LOOKS FROZEN

This is penalty for single thread program. Just don NOT kill it and wait some
time (how much it depends on operation you were performing, reading and
writing data from/to mobile can take much time, especially when you have
stored lot of contacts/events/todos there). This issue is planned to fixed in
0.5 release.


PROGRAM CAN'T CONNECT
(note: this bug is since 0.3 very rare because some a bit more inteligent and
 much more slower connecting procedure allows to connect even if phone was
 kept in wrong state)

Sometimes this program doesn't connect correctly to mobile at first attempt,
trying again mostly fixes it. When problem stays, try to connect to mobile
with some "low level" program (for example minicom) and try some AT command
(just AT should enough - OK should appear, or try ATI - modem should reply
with it's name).

If you know how to reproduce this bug, please send that procedure to me.


SOME CHARACTERS DOESN'T WORK

KAlcatel/alcatool currently supports only GSM characters in most cases. This
contains all non accented latin chacacters, numbers, special signs and few
accented characters (like á,í). In mobile (tested with Alcatel OT 501) you
can enter characters, that won't be read correctly using KAlcatel/alcatool
(all greek and some special symbols). I'm going to solve this, but not now.

If you know how to convert these characters, please send it to me.

This problem should less affect contacts stored on SIM card. They are being
read in Unicode and if you use Unicode fonts, everything should be ok.
