KAlcatel


RELEASE NOTICE

This software is still beta (or alpha) quality, which means that it segfaults
sometimes and can loose your data. The worst issue is that program looks
frozen when it works with mobile. For more details look at "PROGRAM LOOKS
FROZEN" in file BUGS.


APPLICATION DESCRIPTION

This application allows you to manage messages, calls, contacts, todos and
calendar in your Alcatel One Touch 50x and 70x mobile. In fact currently is in
this gui supported just reading, but full functionality will be coded in near
future.

Protocol used by this phone is binary and not documented, so this program
could not guarantee any functionality in your case, but it works well for me.


BUGS & NEW FEATURES

For bugreporting use preferably KDE bug reporting dialog. List of known bugs
is listed in file BUGS.

If you would like some feature in KAlcatel, at first look into TODO file which
contais plans for future versions. If your feature is not listed there or you
think that it is more important and should be done sooner, please feel free to
contact author.


CONTRIBUTION

Any contributors are welcome. Just to avoid wasting your and my (and possible
also someone others) time, please announce me that you want to add/rewrite
some code.
