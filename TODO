known bugs:
 - sometimes this doesn't connect correctly to mobile at first attempt, trying
   again or connecing before using another program (minicom) fixes it, if you
   know any solution send it pleasee to me
 - currently only characters <127 work correctly

 - (DONE) configuration (at least of modem)

for 0.2-alpha:
 - reading of everything - add calls and contacts from SIM
 - saving of document
 - export to csv (and maybe others)

for 0.3-beta:
 - editing of calendar/contacts/...
