for 0.1-prerelease:
 - (DONE) reading of contacts (mobile), calendar, todo
 - (DONE) configuration (at least of modem)

for 0.2-alpha:
 - (DONE) reading of everything - add calls and contacts from SIM
 - (DONE) saving of document
 - (DONE) loading of document
 - (DONE) merging of data

for 0.3-beta:
 - editing of calendar
 - (DONE) editing of contacts
 - (DONE) editing of todos
 - (DONE) contact select dialog
 - (DONE) sending/writing messages
 - write to mobile
 - (DONE) signal and battery monitoring
 - change category behavior in contacts - tree should look like:
   * SIM (include previous sim)
   * general
   * category names...

for 0.4:
 - fix majority of reported bugs, this should be first "stable" release

sometimes (probably till 1.0, but not planned yet):
 - czech translation
 - searching
 - filters
 - export/import data from csv (and maybe others)
 - rewrite reading as separate thread and allow canceling (probably using
   QThread + QProgressDialog)
 - synchronisation with kab (and maybe also korganizer)
 - save and restore positions and size of interface (splitters, list
   headers, toolbars, ...)
 - read clock, set clock as they are in computer, set to + months to remove
   messages ;-)
 - contacts ( sim <-> mobile ) transfer

nice to have features (probable):
 - print support
 - copy & paste whole items over clipboard

nice to have features (possible):
 - simplier interface for non Alcatel phones (without anything what is Alcatel
   specific)
 - some merge with gnokii - there are currently three possibilities I am
   thinking of (I appreciate any help according to this):
    - add alcatel code into gnokii
    - add support for linking with gnokii in kalcatel
    - make some more generic library for accessing mobiles and add to that
      library code from gnokii, alcatool and may be some others - this is IMHO
      best, but also most operose
 - calendar view for calendar items
 - nicer icons ;-)

nice to have features (very unprobable - all this probably needs reading of
flash memory, some decoding of it and write it back, but I'm not able to make
such thing. Can you help with this?):
 - support for messages in phone
 - logo changing
