TODOs for KAlcatel
------------------

Okay, my priorities have changed and it makes most of this file obsolete. The
priority #1 for now is to make Gammu work with Alcatel phones. Next thing that
will come is to port (probably write from scratch) KAlcatel to use Gammu as
backend and use only Qt classes for that to allow compilation also on Win32.

for 0.4-beta:
 - (started) improve contact/phone number selection dialog
 - after creating of item:
    * focus to it
    * update item view
 - remember last screen for update...

for 0.5:
 - fix deleting of some fields
 - write for AT commands
 - try to investigate deleting of items
 - export/import data from csv (and maybe others - vcard)

for 0.6:
 - rewrite reading as separate thread and allow canceling (probably using
   QThread + QProgressDialog)

for 1.0:
 - fix majority of reported bugs

sometimes (probably till 1.0, but not planned yet):
 - `grep -rn '/* TODO:' *`
 - verify deleted items by content (optionally)
 - searching
 - filters
 - synchronisation with kab (and maybe also korganizer)
 - save and restore positions and size of interface (splitters, list
   headers, toolbars, ...)
 - read clock, set clock as they are in computer, set to + months to remove
   messages ;-)
 - contacts ( sim <-> mobile ) transfer

nice to have features (probable):
 - print support
 - copy & paste whole items over clipboard

nice to have features (possible):
 - simplier interface for non Alcatel phones (without anything what is Alcatel
   specific)
 - some merge with gnokii - there are currently three possibilities I am
   thinking of (I appreciate any help according to this):
    - add alcatel code into gnokii
    - add support for linking with gnokii in kalcatel
    - make some more generic library for accessing mobiles and add to that
      library code from gnokii, alcasync and may be some others - this is IMHO
      best, but also most operose
 - calendar view for calendar items
 - nicer icons ;-)

nice to have features (very unprobable - all this probably needs reading of
flash memory, some decoding of it and write it back, but I'm not able to make
such thing. Can you help with this?):
 - support for messages in phone
 - logo changing
