known bugs:
 - sometimes this doesn't connect correctly to mobile at first attempt, trying
   again or connecing before using another program (minicom) fixes it, if you
   know any solution send it please to me
 - currently only characters <127 work correctly

for 0.1-prerelease:
 - (DONE) reading of contacts (mobile), calendar, todo
 - (DONE) configuration (at least of modem)

for 0.2-alpha:
 - (DONE) reading of everything - add calls and contacts from SIM
 - (DONE) saving of document
 - (DONE) loading of document
 - load/save still contains some bugs - sometime one or two days are lost, in calendar start/stop date is lost

for 0.3-beta:
 - editing of calendar/contacts/...
 - sending/writing messages
 - write to mobile

for 0.4:
 - fix majority of reported bugs, this should be first "stable" release

sometimes (till 1.0):
 - czech translation
 - export/import data from csv (and maybe others)
 - rewrite reading as separate thread and allow canceling (probably using QThread + QProgressDialog)
 - move modem initialization (?)
 - synchronisation with kab (and maybe also korganizer)
 - save and restore positions and size of interface (splitters, list headers, toolbars, ...)
 - read clock, set clock as they are in computer
 - contacts sim <-> mobile transfer

nice to have features (probable):
 - print support
 - copy & paste whole items over clipboard
 - try to do something with alarms

nice to have features (possible):
 - simplier interface for non Alcatel phones (without anything what is Alcatel specific)
 - calendar look for calendar items
 - nicer icons ;-)

nice to have features (unprobable):
 - support for messages in phone
 - logo changing
