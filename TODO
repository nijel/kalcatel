known bugs:
 - sometimes this doesn't connect correctly to mobile at first attempt, trying
   again or connecing before using another program (minicom) fixes it, if you
   know any solution send it please to me
 - currently only ASCII characters <127 work correctly

for 0.1-prerelease:
 - (DONE) reading of contacts (mobile), calendar, todo
 - (DONE) configuration (at least of modem)

for 0.2-alpha:
 - (DONE) reading of everything - add calls and contacts from SIM
 - (DONE) saving of document
 - (DONE) loading of document
 - (DONE) merging of data

for 0.3-beta:
 - editing of calendar/contacts/...
 - contact select dialog
 - (DONE) sending/writing messages
 - write to mobile
 - (DONE) signal and battery monitoring
 - change category behavior in contacts - tree should look like:
   * SIM (include previous sim)
   * general
   * category names...

for 0.4:
 - fix majority of reported bugs, this should be first "stable" release

sometimes (till 1.0):
 - czech translation
 - searching
 - filters
 - export/import data from csv (and maybe others)
 - rewrite reading as separate thread and allow canceling (probably using
   QThread + QProgressDialog)
 - synchronisation with kab (and maybe also korganizer)
 - save and restore positions and size of interface (splitters, list
   headers, toolbars, ...)
 - read clock, set clock as they are in computer, set to + months to remove
   messages ;-)
 - contacts sim <-> mobile transfer

nice to have features (probable):
 - print support
 - copy & paste whole items over clipboard
 - try to do something with alarms (this will be probably part of calendar
   editation, because alarms are in fact calendar events of specific type and
   with zero date and at commands support for setting this seems to be broken)

nice to have features (possible):
 - simplier interface for non Alcatel phones (without anything what is Alcatel
   specific)
 - some merge with gnokii - there are currently three possibilities I am
   thinking of (I appreciate any help according to this):
    - add alcatel code into gnokii
    - add support for linking with gnokii in kalcatel
    - make some more generic library for accessing mobiles and add to that
      library code from gnokii, alcatool and may be some others
 - calendar look for calendar items
 - nicer icons ;-)

nice to have features (unprobable - all this probably needs reading of flash
some decoding ot it and write it back, but I'm not able to make such thing.
Can you help with this?):
 - support for messages in phone
 - logo changing
